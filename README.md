## Recomendations
* I would recommend to NothOne whose main goal is to improve small businesses to take it one step further and commersialise those small businesses who have great consistent success while using NorthOne.
* This would benefit both NorthOne and the small business that would qualify for the upgrade, by bringing in more customers because they would now be reaching a wider audience.
* Simple tool could be used since they would have to qualify a company to be set up to be commersialised. A tool that tracks and measures the success and rise in profit of the small business, then NorthOne should set a bar that encourages their companies the reach if they want to be commercialised.
* This tool would be appropriate because it would'nt be expensive too install and it would drive the incentive of the small businesses to work harder to bring in more money by trying to increae their success to reach the bar.
